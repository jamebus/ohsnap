DESCRIPTION

     ohsnap is a program which makes backups of entire filesystems. If the
     filesystem is on a LVM2 logical volume or is btrfs, a snapshot will be
     taken and the backup taken from that. This is ideal for a busy system.

     ohsnap assumes you want a full backup on Sunday and incremental
     backups the following days. It can also retain a configurable number
     of previous cycles.

     If the filesystem type is XFS, xfsdump(8) will be used to conduct the
     backup, otherwise GNU tar(1) is used.

USAGE

     - Edit /usr/local/etc/ohsnap.conf and describe your filesystems.

     - sudo ohsnap
       or
       sudo ohsnap -v

       The latter will log to the terminal in addition to the log file.

     - Watch the fun in /var/log/ohsnap.log.

     - Good? Create a cron job for it.

REQUIREMENTS

     - A mostly POSIX-compliant Bourne shell. Tested using dash.

     - Debian or a derivative (such as Ubuntu). Other GNU/Linux-based
       systems should work with little or no modifications. The only
       Debian-specific features I'm relying on is the adm group and the
       savelog(8) command.

     - LVM2 if you want snapshots of non-btrfs filesystems (optional).

     - xfs-utils and xfsdump (optional, only if backing up XFS filesystems,
       will degrade to GNU tar if not present).

     - btrfs-tools (only if backing up btrfs filesystems).

     - GNU tar (only if backing up non-XFS filesystems).

     - Common UNIX commands like rm(1), mv(1), install(1), cp(1), df(1),
       gzip(1). You have these already unless you have a stripped-down
       system.

COMPRESSION

     Backups may be compressed using a compression tool specified in
     ohsnap.conf or automatically chosen. If auto, ohsnap will choose one
     with a bias toward efficiency. If you want speed, try lzop or gzip
     instead.

BUGS

     - Not portable to other GNU/Linux systems other than Debian and it's
       derivatives.

     - Snapshots filling up while backup in progress not handled.

     - Too specific to my situation.

     - Please report any findings.

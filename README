DESCRIPTION

     ohsnap is a program which makes backups from snapshots of XFS
     filesystems. Non-XFS filesystems are also supported (with no
     snapshots) to backup the root and/or boot filesystem.

     ohsnap assumes you want a full backup on Sunday and incremental
     backups the following days. It can also retain a configurable number
     of previous cycles.

USAGE

     - Edit /usr/local/etc/ohsnap.conf and describe your filesystems.

     - sudo ohsnap
       or
       sudo ohsnap -v

       The latter will log to the terminal in addition to the log file.

     - Watch the fun in /var/log/ohsnap.log.

     - Good? Create a cron job for it.

REQUIREMENTS

     - A mostly POSIX-compliant Bourne shell. Tested using dash.

     - Debian or a derivative (such as Ubuntu). Other GNU/Linux-based
       systems should work with little or no modifications. The only
       Debian-specific features I'm relying on is the adm group and the
       savelog(8) command.

     - LVM2 + XFS filesystems.

     - xfs-utils and xfsdump.

     - Common UNIX commands like rm(1), mv(1), install(1), cp(1), df(1),
       gzip(1). You have these already unless you have a stripped-down
       system.

FUTURE

     Support other filesystems. EXT4 is a good next target. Also see BUGS.

BUGS

     - Not portable to other GNU/Linux systems other than Debian and it's
       derivatives.

     - Too specific to my situation.

     - Doesn't clean up after an unexpected termination. Will leave
       unfinished backup and snapshot volumes hanging around.

     - Please report any findings.
